#### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Branches 
    
If you are interested to add some features or fix some bugs of our code, you must have following some rules:
* Just edit files that another teammate is not using. At momment we have the following organization:
  
  * **Henrique Costa**: *TODO*
  * **Matilde**: *TODO*
  * **Mariana**: *TODO* 

  <br>

* Your **branch name** need to have the following pattern:
  
  ```
  "author_branch-type_branch-name"
  ```
  For example, if Henrique wants to create a *branch* to add a feature to the program, like a new **filter**, he can creates a *branch* like:
  ```
  [PROMPT $] git branch henrique_feature_new-filter
  ```
  **Info(1)**: *underscore* "_" separates patterns (henrique_feature) and *hyphen* "-" separates words inside a pattern (new-filter).
  <br>

  **Info(2)**: If you have doubt about the *branch_type* rule, I recommend you to use one of the *commit Types* in this article:

  <br>

  For more information about *branch convention* (section 4): https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices/

<br> 

#### :pencil: Commits

For best pratices, in order to help to track specified information, we following the **Convential Commits**: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ that is inspired by on the **Angular Commit Guidelines**: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines 

<br>

Example: If Matilde edit her code, but only changes formatting or code style, without changing its functionality, she can make a commit message like:

```
  git commit -m "style: change file1 code style"
```

**Info(1 - *syntax rule*)**: Your commit message must complete correctly the following phrase: If applied, this commit will <commit_message>
<br>


**Info(2)**: it is a little complex use all of the *semantic rules*, so you can use only: 
```<type>[optional scope]: <description>``` in this project.
<br>

The **Convential Commits** documentation is enough but if you speak portuguese and want information in your language you can see in: https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/o-que-e-commit-e-como-usar-commits-semanticos/ and https://rodrigobpzantunes2016.medium.com/padr%C3%B5es-para-escrever-mensagens-git-commit-melhores-3d6ff7ba6b
